# Teaching

I currently teach math classes at a New Jersey state prison through the [Prison Teaching Initative](http://www.prisonteaching.org) (PTI). I am also helping develop a new computer science course for PTI.

During my undergrad, I was a teaching assistant for the following courses at Brown.

* [MATH 1560: Number Theory](https://www.brown.edu/academics/math/course-descriptions), taught by Prof. Mike Rosen (Spring 2017)     

* [CSCI 1570: Design and Analysis of Algorithms](http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs157/), taught by Prof. Paul Valiant (Fall 2015, Fall 2016)    

* [CSCI 1450: Probability and Computing](http://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci1450/), taught by Prof. Erik Sudderth (Spring 2015)      

* [CSCI 0530: Directions: The Matrix in Computer Science](http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs053/current/index.htm), taught by Prof. Phil Klein (Fall 2014)      

I also graded for MATH 1560 (number theory) and MATH 1530 (abstract algebra). -->
