We are a small tutoring group based in Princeton, New Jersey with 
offerings in mathematics, science, and test preparation. Our aim is
to provide high quality tutoring services across academic
disciplines by drawing upon our expertise in scientific and medical 
research. Following the model of apprenticeship in mathematics and
science, our tutoring services are highly personal, effective, and tailored to
students' needs. Currently, we offer:

<ul>
<li> In-person and virtual tutoring services </li>
<li> One-on-one tutoring for middle school through undergraduate grades </li>
<li> SAT/ACT test preparation and college admissions counseling </li>
</ul>

Exact offerings are tutor dependent and 
are described below.

Educational Philosophy 
</h2>
<p>
In the classic text on mathematical pedagogy, 
<i>How to Solve It</i>, George P&oacute;lya writes, 
<i>"Mathematics, you see, is not a spectator sport."</i> 
While effective learning of course includes aspects of spectatorship, 
e.g. in the form of lecture, we agree with P&oacute;lya that true mastery 
of a subject follows mainly from practice. Consequently, our services
incorporate practice throughout, with the foremost goal of teaching students 
to trust and rely on their own reason, intuition, and abilities. 
</p>
<p>
To realize the aim of practice-based learning, we first assess students' 
strengths and areas for  growth. Once identified, we select targeted 
problems, questions, and concepts for practice. By assisting students 
in solving and reasoning through these problems, we help hone their intuition and problem-solving skills. 
In this way, students develop the tools necessary for effective problem-solving 
and self-guided learning, becoming confident individuals prepared for future challenges.
