I am a third-year PhD student in Computer Science at [Princeton University](https://www.cs.princeton.edu), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Ben Raphael](http://compbio.cs.brown.edu).     

My research interests are in algorithms, machine learning, and statistics, with a particular interest in problems arising from biological applications. My current research focuses on developing algorithms for analyzing structured data (e.g. networks).
