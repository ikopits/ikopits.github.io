I am a third-year PhD student in Computer Science at [Princeton University](https://www.cs.princeton.edu), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Ben Raphael](http://compbio.cs.brown.edu).    

I am broadly interested in algorithms with applications in computational biology or machine learning. My current interests are in algorithms for learning and analyzing network interactions.    

I graduated from [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu) in May 2017, and I worked as a Software Engineer at [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com) from Fall 2017 to Fall 2018.

Here is [my CV](chitra_cv_spring_2020.pdf) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JPKTNnMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
