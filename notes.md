# Notes

Some math notes written at various points in my undergrad, mostly on number theory. Disclaimer: there may be errors!

* [Proof that Z/pZ is cyclic](zp_cyclic_math156_spring17.pdf). Wrote this up for a number theory course I TA'd senior year. The proof is very similar to the proof in the [PROMYS](https://www.promys.org) problem sets.

* [Algebraic number theory notes](2530_notes.pdf). Live-TeX'd notes for [MATH2530](http://www.math.brown.edu/~jhs/MA0253/MA0253HomePage.html). Though the notes are sparse towards the end of the semester.

* [Extension of the airplane brainteaser](cs22_problem_9.5c.pdf). Wrote this solution for my friend TA-ing a discrete math class at Brown (which is why the problem is framed in terms of people taking labeled lunches from a fridge).

* [Proof that there are infinitely many primes 4 mod 15](infinite_primes_4_mod_15.pdf). I believe [Tony Qiao](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tony-qiao-313b86b1) told me about this proof.

* [An elementary construction of finite fields](elementary_finite_fields_construction.pdf). Also inspired by the [PROMYS](https://www.promys.org) problem sets.
