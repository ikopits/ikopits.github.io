# Notes

Some math notes written at various points during my undergrad, mostly on number theory. Note that there may be errors in the notes.

* [Proof that Z/pZ is cyclic](notes/zp_cyclic_math156_spring17.pdf) from a number theory course I was a teaching assistant for.

* [Algebraic number theory notes](notes/2530_notes.pdf) which I Live-TeX'd for [MATH2530](http://www.math.brown.edu/~jhs/MA0253/MA0253HomePage.html). The notes end prematurely as I stopped typing up notes in the last few weeks of the course.

* [Extension of the airplane brainteaser](notes/cs22_problem_9.5c.pdf) from a homework problem for a discrete math class at Brown that my friend was a teaching assistant for. Note that the problem is phrased in terms of taking labeled lunches from a fridge, rather than taking seats in an airplane.

* [Proof that there are infinitely many primes 4 mod 15](notes/infinite_primes_4_mod_15.pdf). [Tony Qiao](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tony-qiao-313b86b1) told me about this proof.

* [An elementary construction of finite fields](notes/elementary_finite_fields_construction.pdf).
