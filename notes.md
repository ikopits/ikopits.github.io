# Notes

Notes written at various points during undergrad, mostly on number theory. Disclaimer: there may be errors!

* [Proof that Z/pZ is cyclic](notes/zp_cyclic_math156_spring17.pdf). I wrote these notes for a class I TA'd.

* [Algebraic number theory notes](notes/2530_notes.pdf). I Live-TeX'd these class notes for [MATH2530](http://www.math.brown.edu/~jhs/MA0253/MA0253HomePage.html), though they're missing content from the last few classes.  

* [An elementary construction of finite fields](notes/elementary_finite_fields_construction.pdf).

* [Extension of the airplane brainteaser](notes/cs22_problem_9.5c.pdf). I wrote these up for a discrete math class that my friend TA'd. Note that the problem is phrased in terms of taking labeled lunches from a fridge, rather than taking seats in an airplane.

* [Proof that there are infinitely many primes 4 mod 15](notes/infinite_primes_4_mod_15.pdf). I was told about this proof by [Tony Qiao](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tony-qiao-313b86b1).
